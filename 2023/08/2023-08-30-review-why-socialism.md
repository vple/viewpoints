### You Have Skin in the Game

> Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? I believe for a number of reasons that it is.

I originally read this as Einstein's version of "this is why you should hear me out, even though I'm not an expert on economics or social issues."
But this doesn't seem to fit in with his argument, as it seems like he's arguing against himself.

Instead, it makes more sense as "you, dear reader, can express views on economic and social issues despite not having expertise."
Which Einstein then tries to show.

#### Economic Experts are Overrated

> Let us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific knowledge.
> It might appear that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible.
> But in reality such methodological differences do exist.

Einstein's claim: hard/classical sciences != economic science.
And, as he'll say, economic science is not reliable / not hard fact.

> The discovery of general laws in the field of economics is made difficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often affected by many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately.
> In addition, the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so-called civilized period of human history has—as is well known—been largely influenced and limited by causes which are by no means exclusively economic in nature.

One, you can't (or it's hard to) isolate what contributes towards some economic condition/state.
In other words, you can't really prove cause and effect.
Unstated is the contrast with classical science, where a scientist must isolate factors that they want to test in order to evaluate some hypothesis.

Two, lots of non-economic things affect economic state.
It's not isolated, it's not self-contained.

> For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence to conquest.
> The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and economically, as the privileged class of the conquered country.
> They seized for themselves a monopoly of the land ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own ranks.
> The priests, in control of education, made the class division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of values by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously, guided in their social behavior.

Einstein uses a very broad example, but he says throughout human history some group in power uses their power to justify that they should be rich/wealthy.
And so they have great wealth, but they didn't get it via economic means.

I don't know much history, and this is a very very broad argument, but it seems fair to believe that it does happen (and to great effect).
First example off the top of my head relates to monarchies--a royal family claims that they have divine right (which Einstein's priesthood then affirms).
I'm way too light on backing details, but I know this happened with England, China, and Japan.

> But historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we really overcome what Thorstein Veblen called “the predatory phase” of human development.
> The observable economic facts belong to that phase and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases.
> Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state can throw little light on the socialist society of the future.

I don't understand at all what Einstein is referencing, but he implies that we're in a current "economic era" and that a much more fair society would be a completely new era.
The two would be so far apart that the rules of today would not work at all in a different era.
Probably analogous to world-changing technologies: printing press, steam engine, the internet.

All of this going to say that an "expert" isn't more credible in what they can say about a future socialist society.

#### Scientists Are Bystanders; We Are In the Ring

> Second, socialism is directed towards a social-ethical end.
> Science, however, cannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends.
> But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals and—if these ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorous—are adopted and carried forward by those many human beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.

Science, pretty much by definition, is about telling you how the world works.
You can use that to shape how things might be, but science alone doesn't accomplish anything.

Socialism, however, has a goal.
These goals are crafted and shaped by luminaries.
Assuming these ideas stick around, these ideas guide how we act and therefore shapes how society changes.

In other words, big ideas shape the world (slowly).
A bit easier to grasp when recognizing that this applies to any concept.

For example, family-oriented idioms stick around and reinforce how important familial units are.
"Respect your elders."
"Family is everything."
This isn't to say that every family is a strong one, but it's very clear that family bonds affect society greatly (after all, children typically/preferably live with their parents).

> For these reasons, we should be on our guard not to overestimate science and scientific methods when it is a question of human problems; and we should not assume that experts are the only ones who have a right to express themselves on questions affecting the organization of society.

Einstein's summarizing.
Economic science can only take you so far, and we should be able to express our opinions on something that we are a part of.
